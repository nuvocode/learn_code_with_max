This repository will contain the code written in my Learn to Code 101 Workshop. Feel free to clone this repo and follow along with the youtube video.

Downloads
First things first. Let's get your development environtment ready.

1. You need a code editor. For this we're going to use Visual Studio Code as the industry standard. Here is the link:
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

If the link is not working, just google "Visual Studio Code Download" for the link. 

2. Install Homebrew:
https://brew.sh/

This will allow you to install CLI's (Command Line Interface's). 
These are programs that allow you to execute commands from the Terminal.

Commands you can run: brew doctor, brew upgrade

One example is the GitHub CLI:
https://cli.github.com/

Visit this link, open your terminal. (Install Homebrew First), then install GitHub CLI.

3. GitHub Desktop. It's the best way to manage code repositories like this one and update and maintain the code you write.
